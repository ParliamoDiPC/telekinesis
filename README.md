# telekinesis

In Hypixel SkyBlock, the Telekinesis enchant is one of the core things a player will put on its tools after a couple minutes.
It basically makes drops go directly into your inventory.

Since I really miss it on Vanilla as a function, I made this plugin to add it!
Actually it isn't a real enchant, you have to type the /telekinesis (or /tk) command while holding your weapon and you have to "pay" 64 Lapis Lazuli to get it.

Hope you will enjoy!
